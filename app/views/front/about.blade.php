        <h3>Pack&Track, who we are and what we do</h3>
        <p>We are Pack&Track, this site originated from the idea to improve the delivery system which is now used within several delivery
        companies around the globe. We want to improve in several ways. One of these ways is to give the client a better pinpoint
        location of where his/her package currently resides. Another improvement is the way the handling of every individual packaging is logged.
        We log our files through a system which make solely use of the website. The app which is loaded on the smartphones of our couriers
        also makes use of this system.</p>

        <h3>Package delivery Pinpointing</h3>
        <p>If the package resides in its final leg of its delivery we use the GPS coordinates which we retrieve from the smartphone of the courier which
        is transporting the package. The location which is shown on the website is a rough estimate, but is a lot more accurate than what is currently
        given with the systems which are now used.</p>

        <h3>Handling, easier and quicker</h3>
        <p>Due to the new approach which makes intesive use of the website we are able to use this system without the need to create a separate application
        which is normally used in the distribution locations. This makes for a quicker logging of every step of your package and as such we keep you better
        up to date.</p>
